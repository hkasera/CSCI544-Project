# Maths Word Problem Solver in Hindi 

_CSCI 544 Final Project_

The ability to solve word problems is an integral part of our mathematical education because real-life problems almost never present themselves to us in mathematical form. The process of solving word problems involves understanding the components of the problem written in natural language in conjunction with mathematical reasoning.

The aim of our project is to construct a very basic Hindi word problem solver which solves elementary school math problems involving only a single mathematical operation.

Solving word problems is an interesting problem because of the inability to formulate a mathematical representation of the text automatically as it involves additional mathematical reasoning apart from comprehending natural language.
All the prior research work in this domain focuses on English language. There is significant work done by Cognitive Computation Group at Illinois and Institute of Information Science at Taiwan which we will use as a reference for our project.
